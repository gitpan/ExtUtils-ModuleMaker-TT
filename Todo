TODO list for Perl module ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::TT

Functionality

	- warnings before overwriting files or a "force=>1" option

Testing

	- Incomplete code coverage (from Devel::Cover)

		* arguments to complete_build() (though makeperlmod uses this
		  successfully)

		* test without CHANGES_IN_POD

		* test 'Module::Build and proxy Makefile.PL'

		* build_single_pm from a name, not just a hashref (again,
		  makeperlmod does this successfully)

		* test -e MANIFEST true and -d lib false

		* test "can't find base dir" outcome in single_pm

		* test custom templates

		* test can't write to template directory

	- Test how subroutine print looks without NEED_NEW
	
	- Test all variations of config variables in templates

	- Test makeperlmod

	- Test critical failure handling
	
		* have a template dir but template not found

		* not in a writeable directory
	
Portability

	- Use more portable routines for file/path manipulation (but does
	  ExtUtils::ModuleMaker do this?)
